  description: |
    This catalog will include vector and raster datasets that are part of the "Mars Orbital Catalog of
    Aqueous Alteration Signatures" (MOCAAS), global repository of secondary minerals formed through interaction with
    water on Mars. This work is based on the analysis of orbital imaging spectroscopy data from the OMEGA/Mars Express
    and CRISM/MRO near-infrared instruments. A database and a set of high-resolution global maps (200 m/pix) are
    produced which provide a large collection of these "aqueous" secondary mineral deposits, most of which were not
    previously reported.
