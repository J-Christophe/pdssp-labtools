  description: |
    Global repository of secondary minerals formed through interaction with water on Mars. This work is based on the
    analysis of orbital imaging spectroscopy data from the OMEGA/Mars Express and CRISM/MRO near-infrared instruments.
    A database and a set of high-resolution global maps (200 m/pix) are produced which provide a large collection of
    these "aqueous" secondary mineral deposits, most of which were not previously reported.
